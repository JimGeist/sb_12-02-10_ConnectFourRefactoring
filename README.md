## Connect Four OO Refactoring

Assignment involved taking the non-Object Oriented version of the Connect Four game (starter code supplied) and refactoring it into an OO version.

#Part One#
Create a game class, Game, with all the code in the Game class. 
A new game is created via
new Game(6, 7);
where 6 is the board height and 7 is the board width.

#Part Two#
Add a button to start a new game. The game should only start when the button is clicked and clicking the button at anytime will restart the game.
Add a property that prevents moves after the game has ended.

Please go to [Connect Four Refactoring](https://jimgeist.github.io/sb_12-02-10_ConnectFourRefactoring/) for the big game!
